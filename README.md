## Patcher for ReMinecraftPE

https://github.com/ReMinecraftPE

**WEB_SRV_ROOT_DIR** contains the necessary patch_map.txt to tell the tool what to patch (NOTE: It is just an example, you can tweak this the way you like). It should also contain the files and directories that are stated in the keys of the key-value pair, but we cannot host these on GitHub legally.
You must use a 3rd party content server (see the source code). You can self-host one if you'd like, and share the URL with people!

Some unused functions remain as remnants that could help if one wants to improve/optimize the way it works (maybe download a ZIP first and then unpack/patch everything), or do some things in a better/cleaner way. This project was done in a bit of a rush...
